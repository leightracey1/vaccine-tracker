# vaccine-tracker

I built this vaccine tracker to alert myself of vaccine availabilities at my local hospital in order to schedule appointments for my grandparents. It uses cheerio to scrape the hospital website and the Twilio API to automatically text myself when it notices a change in text.

## TO-DO
- change TWILIO API for Twitter API and post to Twitter account as vaccines become available. 
- After posting (or texting) once, turn off the alert for that hospital for atleast 24 hours. 
- Add express to application and host on cloud so it is always running. 

## This application is no longer in use since vaccine availability has increased.
